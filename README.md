## Backup your NeoVim config before install this one.

## Installation
1. Download this repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:fadyio/nvim.git
```
2. Put the contents of this repo where NeoVim can find them. On Linux this is most likely `$HOME/.config/nvim`.
On Linux this is `$HOME/.local/share/nvim`. Otherwise check the output of `:lua print(vim.fn.stdpath('data'))`.
3. Open NeoVim and let it install Packer and all the dependencies (ignore the errors).
4. Open NeoVim again and wait for nvim-treesitter to install all of its dependencies (ignore the errors).

If you're updating an existing config and you're facing some issues,
I would recommend that you remove the contents of *data* folder and retry the installation. (It has helped me in the past)

## Icons
Icons and other special characters are used all around the config to give NeoVim a prettier look.
However, your terminal will not display these icons correctly unless it uses the correct font.

Install one of the icon fonts listed [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/). Just follow their instructions for your specific OS.
After installation is complete, don't forget to configure your terminal to start using the new font. 
Each terminal does this differently, so be sure to checkout [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) if you run into any troubles.
